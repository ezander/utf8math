This package is intended to allow users to directly enter mathematical
symbols from the corresponding Unicode code tables directly into their
math formulas. 

Nice thing is that you can directly see you alphas, sums, tensor
products or whatever in the editor you're using. The style file will
register the corresponding unicode codepoint and translate it into a
TeX/LaTeX command

* Many specialized mathematical symbols require certain extra packages
  to be loaded: currently there are: amsmath, amssymb, ...

* Some symbols could have different representations, currently no step
  is made to allow customisation for that as there is too much
  possible variability here. Maybe in the future, and only for some
  strict subset of symbols. As for now just override definitions you
  don't like.

* Currently restricted to LaTeX, generic TeX package should follow (this
  shouldn't be too hard)

* Their should be a package for Emacs that allows direct insertion of
  symbols into TeX code. (Currently I only use this package for text
  copied from PDF files...)

* More documentation on features and implementation will come (but not now...)


Well, maybe needless to say, but all the files in this project are
UTF8 encoded. That means don't try to modify or convert a file to
something other (like windows codepage stuff or iso 8859-something).
